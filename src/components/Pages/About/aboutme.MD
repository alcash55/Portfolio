## 👋 About Me

Hey, I’m **Alex Cash** — a **Software Engineer** who enjoys building clean, scalable, and well-designed systems. I’m passionate about creating software that not only works great under the hood but also delivers a smooth, intuitive experience for users.

I work across the stack, but my favorite projects are the ones that blend **front-end precision** with **backend performance**. I love working with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Go**, and I lean on tools like **MUI**, **Tailwind**, **Vite**, and **Bun.js** to move fast and keep things maintainable.

### 💡 What Drives Me

- Writing code that’s **simple, clear, and reliable**
- Building systems that scale without sacrificing readability
- Collaborating with teams who care about **craft and efficiency**
- Always learning and refining how I work

### ⚙️ Tech Snapshot

**Languages:** TypeScript, Go, JavaScript, SQL  
**Frameworks & Tools:** React, Single-SPA, MUI, Tailwind CSS, Vite, Bun.js, Node.js  
**Databases:** Couchbase, PostgreSQL  
**Other:** GitHub Actions, REST APIs, CI/CD

### 🥍 Outside of Work

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me **coaching lacrosse** or spending time with my **two dogs**. Coaching has taught me a lot about communication, patience, and leadership — lessons that carry directly into how I approach software development and teamwork.
